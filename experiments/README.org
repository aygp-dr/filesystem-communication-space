* Overview

This directory contains experimental code and test results for filesystem-based IPC mechanisms. All experiments should be documented with their test platforms and results.

* Test Platforms

Our experiments are conducted across multiple platforms to ensure portability and understand platform-specific behaviors:

** Primary Development Platform (Raspberry Pi)
#+begin_src
Linux pi 6.12.20+rpt-rpi-v8 #1 SMP PREEMPT Debian 1:6.12.20-1+rpt1~bpo12+1 (2025-03-19) aarch64 GNU/Linux
#+end_src

** Additional Test Platforms

*** FreeBSD (nexushive)
#+begin_src
FreeBSD nexushive 14.3-RELEASE FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE releng/14.3-n271432-8c9ce319fef7 GENERIC amd64
#+end_src

*** macOS (Apple Silicon)
#+begin_src
Darwin Jasons-MacBook-Pro.local 24.1.0 Darwin Kernel Version 24.1.0: Thu Oct 10 21:03:15 PDT 2024; root:xnu-11215.41.3~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000 arm64

* Experiment Structure

Each experiment should be organized as follows:

#+begin_src
experiments/
├── YYYY-MM-DD-experiment-name/
│   ├── README.org           # Experiment description and results
│   ├── code/               # Source code
│   ├── data/               # Test data and results
│   └── plots/              # Visualizations
#+end_src

* Running Experiments

To run all experiments:
#+begin_src bash
make experiments
#+end_src

To run benchmarks:
#+begin_src bash
make benchmark
#+end_src

* Platform-Specific Notes

** Linux
- Full POSIX compliance
- inotify available for file system events
- /proc and /sys filesystems provide additional IPC mechanisms

** FreeBSD
- kqueue for file system events
- Different /proc implementation
- Jails may affect filesystem namespace visibility

** macOS
- FSEvents API for file system monitoring
- Different semaphore implementation
- SIP (System Integrity Protection) may affect some operations

* Experiment Guidelines

1. Always document the test platform(s) used
2. Include timing information and resource usage
3. Test with multiple file systems when relevant
4. Consider security implications (permissions, race conditions)
5. Document any platform-specific behavior observed
