# IPC Test Results and Options

## FIFO Test Results

### Test Setup
- Created named pipe: `instrumented/debug.fifo`
- Tested bidirectional communication
- Successfully passed data through FIFO

### Results
1. **Initial Data Test**
   - Wrote: apple, banana, cherry, date
   - Successfully read all items
   - FIFO cleared after reading

2. **Additional Data Test**
   - Wrote: elephant, fox, giraffe
   - Data remained in FIFO until read
   - Confirmed FIFO empty after consumption

### Key Findings
- FIFOs are blocking by default (reader waits for writer)
- Data is consumed on read (not persistent)
- Multiple writes accumulate until read
- Suitable for stream-based IPC

## Other IPC Options

### 1. Unix Domain Sockets
```bash
# Server
nc -lU /tmp/socket.sock

# Client
echo "data" | nc -U /tmp/socket.sock
```

### 2. Shared Memory (via mmap)
- Fastest IPC method
- Direct memory access
- Requires synchronization

### 3. Message Queues
- POSIX message queues
- System V message queues
- Priority-based delivery

### 4. Semaphores
- For synchronization
- Binary or counting
- Process coordination

### 5. Regular Files
- Simple but requires polling
- Persistent storage
- File locking needed

### 6. Signals
- Limited data capacity
- Real-time signals (SIGRTMIN+n)
- Good for notifications

### 7. D-Bus
- High-level IPC
- Service discovery
- Type safety

### 8. Memory-mapped files
```bash
# Create shared memory file
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/shared.mem bs=1024 count=1
```

## Performance Comparison
| Method | Latency | Throughput | Complexity |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| Shared Memory | Lowest | Highest | High |
| FIFO | Low | High | Low |
| Unix Sockets | Low | High | Medium |
| TCP Sockets | Medium | Medium | Low |
| Files | High | Low | Low |
