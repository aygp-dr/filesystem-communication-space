# FIFO Experiment Status

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Basic FIFO Testing
- Created `debug.fifo` named pipe
- Tested bidirectional communication
- Verified data persistence until read
- Confirmed FIFO empties after consumption

### 2. Node.js IPC Implementation
- **fifo-writer.js**: Writes processed data with function tracing
- **fifo-reader.js**: Reads data with memory tracking and logging
- Successfully demonstrated inter-process communication

### 3. Function Call Tracing
- Implemented trace wrapper for timing function calls
- Logs all function calls to `function-calls.log` with:
  - Timestamp
  - Function name
  - Arguments
  - Results
  - Process ID

### 4. Memory Usage Monitoring
- Real-time heap usage tracking
- Reports min/max/average memory consumption
- Samples taken every 100ms during execution

### 5. Test Scripts
- **fifo_test.sh**: Basic FIFO test with word data
- **trace-demo.sh**: Comprehensive demo with strace support
- **test-fifo-complete.sh**: Quick test with timeout
- **demo-summary.sh**: Summary of all features

## Performance Results
- FIFO communication latency: <1ms
- Function tracing overhead: ~0ms for simple operations
- Memory usage: ~4.35MB average heap for Node.js processes

## Platform Notes
- Tested on FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE
- strace not available (use truss/dtrace instead)
- All paths use relative references from script location

## Next Steps
- Implement dtrace probes for FreeBSD
- Add benchmarking for different IPC methods
- Create Python version for comparison
