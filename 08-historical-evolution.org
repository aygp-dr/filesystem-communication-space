* From Unix Pipes to Modern IPC

** Overview

This chapter traces the historical development of filesystem-based IPC mechanisms, from early Unix systems to modern implementations, examining how design decisions were made and how they evolved.

** The Early Days: Unix V6 and V7

*** The Birth of Pipes (1973)

/* Early Unix pipe implementation concept
 * 
 * In Unix V6 (1975), pipes were implemented using the filesystem:
 * - A pipe was actually an inode on disk
 * - It had no directory entry (unnamed)
 * - Used circular buffer semantics
 * - Maximum size was 4096 bytes (8 disk blocks)
 */

struct historic_pipe {
    int read_fd;
    int write_fd;
    char *buffer;      // In V6, this was disk blocks
    int read_pos;
    int write_pos;
    int size;
};

/* Ken Thompson's elegant pipe() system call
 * "The number of system calls in Unix is one of its best features"
 */
int historic_pipe_create(int pipefd[2]) {
    // In original Unix:
    // 1. Allocate an inode
    // 2. Set up file descriptors
    // 3. Point both FDs to same inode
    // 4. Set read/write flags appropriately
    
    // Modern equivalent
    return pipe(pipefd);
}

/* Doug McIlroy's vision: "garden hose" connection
 * 
 * From "A Research Unix Reader" (1986):
 * "This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing
 * and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs
 * to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface."

Problem in early Unix: Pipes only worked between related processes
(parent-child). How to communicate between unrelated processes?

Solution attempts:
1. Signals - too limited (just numbers)
2. Shared files - race conditions, not FIFO
3. System V IPC - complex, not file-based

FIFOs were the elegant solution:
- Simple: just a special file
- Familiar: same API as pipes

The Unix community was divided:

BSD Camp: "Everything is a file! Keep it simple!"
- Stuck with filesystem-based IPC
- Enhanced sockets, added Unix domain sockets
- Made FIFOs more efficient

System V Camp: "Performance matters! Add features!"
- Created separate IPC subsystem
- Added powerful but complex primitives
- Influenced by database needs

Resolution: POSIX (1988-2001) included both approaches
- POSIX message queues: filesystem names, better API
- POSIX shared memory: shm_open() uses filesystem

        Modern Linux IPC Patterns:
        
        1. Eventfd + Epoll:
           - Create eventfd for notifications
           - Monitor with epoll for scalability
           - Perfect for thread/process coordination
        
        2. memfd + Unix sockets:
           - Create anonymous memory file (memfd_create)
           - Pass FD through Unix socket
           - Shared memory without filesystem
        
        3. Inotify + Atomic rename:
           - Watch directory for IN_MOVED_TO
           - Producer atomically renames files
           - Consumer gets instant notification
        
        4. io_uring for everything:
           - Submit I/O operations via shared ring
           - No syscalls in fast path
           - Batching and async everything
        
        5. FUSE for custom IPC:
           - Implement custom filesystem
           - IPC through file operations
           - Language-agnostic interface

"""
From Thompson and Ritchie's elegant pipes to modern io_uring,
filesystem IPC has evolved but core ideas remain:

Timeless Principles:
- Simple primitives compose into complex systems
- The filesystem provides a universal namespace  
- Atomicity enables lock-free algorithms
- Everything old is new again (io_uring ≈ VMS QIO)

The tension between "everything is a file" and performance
continues to drive innovation.

        Timeless Design Principles:
        
        1. Simplicity Wins
           - Pipes succeeded because they're simple
           - Complex IPC mechanisms rarely survive
           - Easy to understand = easy to use correctly
        
        2. Composition Over Configuration
           - Small tools that connect beat monoliths
           - Filesystem provides natural composition
           - Let users build what they need
        
        3. Atomicity Is Fundamental
           - Can't build reliable systems without it
           - rename() is the unsung hero of Unix
           - Modern systems still discovering this
        
        4. Performance Can't Be Ignored
           - Beautiful abstractions die if too slow
           - But premature optimization also kills
           - Balance is key
        
        5. Compatibility Matters
           - POSIX standardization was crucial
           - Breaking changes kill adoption
           - Evolution beats revolution
        
        6. Security Is Not Optional
           - Early Unix was too trusting
           - Retrofitting security is painful
           - Modern systems must design for hostility
